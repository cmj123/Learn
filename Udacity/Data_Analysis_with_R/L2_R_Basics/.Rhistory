# 1. Run the code below to create the vector 'udacious'.
# You need to highlight all of the lines of the code and then
# run it. You should see "udacious" appear in the workspace.
udacious <- c("Chris Saden", "Lauren Castellano",
"Sarah Spikes","Dean Eckles",
"Kunal Chawla")

# You should see something like "chr[1:7]" in the 'Environment'
# or 'Workspace' tab. This is because you created a 'vector' with
# 7 names that have a 'type' of character. The arrow-like
# same type: character (most programmers call these strings),
# Chris Saden is the first entry so [1]
# Kunal Chawla is the seventh entry so [7]
# ANOTHER HELPFUL TIP: You can add values to a vector.

# 3. Run the following two lines of code. You can highlight both lines
# of code and run them.
mystery = nchar(udacious)
mystery
# You just created a new vector called mystery. What do you
# think is in this vector? (scroll down for the answer)
# Mystery is a vector that contains the number of characters
# which locations or indices in the vector contain a name
# 5. Let's use this boolean vector, mystery, to subset our
# udacious vector. What do you think the result will be when
# running the line of code below?
udacious[mystery == 11]
